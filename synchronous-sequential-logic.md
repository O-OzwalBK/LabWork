## Design steps for Synchronous Sequential Circuit
- Select the model to be implemented either Moore or Mealy.
- Draw the state diagram for the problem.
- Obtain the state table.
- Use state reduction method if necessary.
- Assign binary codes to the states.
- Decide the type and number of flip-flops required.
- Derive the excitation and synthesis table.
- Derive the simplified flip-flop input and output equation. K-map can be used.
- Draw the circuit according to the equation.
